# Changelog

All notable changes to Tachyon are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Older history lives in the git log and the
Marketplace release notes.

## 0.30.1 — Continuity polish

### Fixed
- The continuity re-injection no longer points at `cat .tachyon/roles/<agent>.md` when that role doc doesn't
  exist (it only appears for agents you've actually re-anchored) — no more `cat` of a missing file.

## 0.30.0 — Per-agent continuity + richer diffs

### Added
- **Per-agent continuity — each agent keeps its working memory across session boundaries.** An agent now
  maintains a short continuity brief (`.tachyon/continuity/<agent>.md`: current goal, working state, decisions,
  next steps, open threads). When the agent crosses a **discontinuity** — a context compaction, a `/clear`, a
  restart, or a new session — Tachyon automatically types a "rebuild your context" pointer into the pane so the
  agent picks up where it left off, instead of starting blank. It is **hands-off for you**: the agent writes the
  brief (nudged by Tachyon when it's missing or falling behind), and Tachyon re-injects it on its own. Crucially,
  a **clean same-session resume is NOT re-injected** (no double-context). A sidebar badge shows
  fresh / **◐ stale** / **○ missing**, and `Tachyon: Re-inject Continuity` forces it on demand. claude-only in v1;
  no LLM cost (the agent authors the brief). `.tachyon/continuity/` is gitignored.
- **Richer Edit/Write diffs in the Activity view** — tool diffs now render TUI-style: a per-line gutter with old/
  new line numbers, the +/− sign, syntax-highlighted code (by file type), and green/red row backgrounds, instead
  of flat monospace text.

## 0.29.2 — Toggle isolation on an existing agent

### Fixed
- **Turning on `isolate: transcript` (or `harness:`) for an agent that already has history now takes effect on
  Restart.** Previously the agent's recorded config home was pinned to where its earlier sessions lived, so a
  restart kept looking there and the newly-isolated session showed an empty Activity view. A restart mints a
  fresh session, so it now re-homes to the current config home (old history stays where it was — a transcript
  can't be moved; resuming an existing session still uses its original home). A `claude --continue`/`--resume`
  agent, which owns its own session, still needs a delete + recreate to re-home.

## 0.29.1 — Task-list rendering + Studio isolate toggle

### Fixed
- **Markdown task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) rendered as stray empty boxes in the Activity feed.** The upstream
  task-list plugin emits malformed, space-less checkbox markup; Tachyon now renders each item as a proper
  styled checkbox glyph (read-only, matching the rest of the cockpit).

### Added
- **`Isolate transcript` checkbox in the Agent Studio.** The spec-240 per-agent transcript isolation is now a
  one-click toggle when creating/editing a claude agent (still off by default; claude-only; hidden when the
  heavier `Isolated harness` is on, which already isolates the transcript).

### Changed
- **`Open transcript` moved from the Activity header to a command.** The raw runtime `.jsonl` is a power-user /
  debug escape hatch, so it's now the `Tachyon: Open Raw Transcript` palette command (targets the active
  Activity panel) instead of a header button — the rendered, durable Activity log is the primary surface.

## 0.29.0 — Backward paging + per-agent transcript isolation

### Added
- **Load earlier activity (in-panel backward paging).** The Activity view can now reach OLDER history without
  leaving the panel — a "Load earlier activity" button grows the rendered window backward over the durable log,
  keeping your scroll position anchored on the item you were reading (no jump). Bounded (it defers to "open
  transcript" past a hard cap, so the payload stays sane).
- **`isolate: transcript` — per-agent transcript namespace (spec 240).** Declare it on a claude agent to give
  it its OWN claude config home (a separate transcript namespace) WITHOUT the heavier `harness:` MCP isolation:

  ```yaml
  agents:
    reviewer:
      cmd: claude
      isolate: transcript
  ```

  Now multiple agents that share ONE folder each get an attributable session, an in-TUI `/resume`/`/clear` that
  the Activity view follows, and their own durable activity log — while still loading the workspace project
  config (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, which are cwd-relative) and inheriting your existing claude
  login (no re-auth). The fix for "several agents in the same folder, one shows no activity."

### Fixed
- Session attribution is now drift-safe: the config home a session was written under is persisted, so a later
  `isolate`/`harness` toggle or rename can't make Tachyon look in the wrong place; startup GC no longer reaps a
  still-referenced transcript home.

## 0.28.1 — Activity in shared folders

### Fixed
- **The Activity view was empty for agents that share a workspace folder.** When ≥2 agents run in the same
  directory (the common case), the durable-log writer was over-suppressed and captured nothing, so the cockpit
  showed "Waiting for activity…" for a working agent. It now attributes each agent's session safely by its
  captured uuid or unique title even in a shared folder (only the genuinely ambiguous, id-less case is gapped,
  with an honest notice) — so each agent's history shows correctly. No misattribution: the only ambiguous
  fallback (a bare "newest in this folder" scan) is skipped on a shared cwd.

## 0.28.0 — Durable activity history

### Added
- **The Activity view now keeps each agent's full, normalized history — durably.** A per-agent activity log
  (`.tachyon/activity/<agent>.jsonl`) is written continuously by an always-on writer, so the cockpit shows a
  complete, stitched timeline across `/clear`, `/resume`, context compaction, fresh starts and restarts —
  history that would otherwise be lost when the runtime rotates session files. The log is a normalized
  projection (not a raw clone): provenance pointers back to the source records, content-addressed copies of
  the images it renders, and it survives runtime-side pruning.
- **Session & compaction boundaries are rendered as separators.** Compaction shows "context compacted" with
  the token delta and an expandable summary; session changes show "new session" / "resumed session" /
  "restarted session" / "forked session" — labeled from Tachyon's own Start/Restart/Resume/Fork actions when
  it performs them, inferred from the transcript otherwise.
- **Rich rendering in the Activity feed** (since 0.27): markdown via markdown-it (tables, task lists, quotes),
  syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy, Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX (KaTeX), thinking blocks, tool diffs,
  inline images with click-to-zoom, a live "working…" indicator, in-feed search, and a visible "recent N of
  M" cap notice instead of silently dropping older activity.

### Changed
- The Activity panel is now a read-only subscriber to the durable log (it no longer tails the runtime
  transcript directly). Opening a long session is bounded (fast) instead of re-reading the whole file.
- Post-compaction artifacts (the continuation summary, `/`-command wrappers, local-command output) are no
  longer mis-rendered as human chat messages.

### Notes
- Per-agent history is captured from now forward; on a folder shared by ≥2 agents, session stitching is
  suppressed (an honest "history stitching limited" notice) rather than risk mis-attribution.

## 0.27.0 — New sidebar

### Changed
- **The Tachyon sidebar is now a purpose-built webview panel, replacing the native tree.** Icon tabs per
  section (Agents, Terminals, Pipelines, Schedules, Commands, Runbooks, Pins), a global `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K`
  search across the whole fleet, capability-gated per-row actions with a consistent `…` overflow menu
  (Edit in Studio / Edit YAML / Delete), multi-root folders shown together and grouped, a view toolbar
  (server inspector / refresh / settings), live state for every section, and full keyboard accessibility.
- The legacy tree is removed (the `tachyon.sidebar.legacyTree` opt-in is gone). All existing commands and
  Studios are unchanged — the panel drives the same actions.

### Added
- Per-section "new …" create buttons; Commands/Runbooks show real run state (running/passed/failed) with
  open-output and step expansion; pipelines gate Run/Cancel/Dismiss/Review by run state and auto-expand on
  start; schedules reflect paused state; an honest empty state with an "Initialize Tachyon" action.

## 0.26.0 — Zero-config Bridge

### Added
- **Every Tachyon-spawned agent reaches the MCP Bridge automatically.** Tachyon injects the
  Bridge at spawn — Claude via an additive `--mcp-config`, Codex via an additive
  `-c mcp_servers.tachyon_bridge=…`, and an isolated-harness Claude has it folded into its
  scoped (`--strict-mcp-config`) file. Injection re-runs on **spawn, restart, resume, and fork**
  (a momentarily-down Bridge self-heals on the next start), and the token never lands on the
  command line. **No `.mcp.json` / `config.toml` registration is needed** for agents Tachyon
  spawns. `Tachyon: Connect Agent Runtime` remains, now scoped to **external/manual** sessions
  you start yourself.

### Fixed
- An isolated-harness agent with `inherit: none` no longer silently loses the Bridge — it is
  always folded into the materialized strict MCP file, so the agent can still call
  `complete_node` / `write_input`.

### Changed
- Pipeline preflight now treats a Tachyon-spawned Claude node as Bridge-capable (injection
  guarantees it — no project `.mcp.json` evidence required); a node whose command disables MCP
  (`--safe-mode`) is correctly reported as unable to signal completion.

### Removed
- The discontinued **layouts** feature was retired (legacy config keys remain tolerated).

### Internal
- The engine is now decoupled from VS Code behind a host port, enforced by a CI boundary guard.
- The `Workspace` is headless-testable (`createForTest` + an in-memory host).

## 0.25.0 — Agent Pipelines, input-driven
- Input-driven pipelines: one definition becomes a reusable workflow run per issue, with agent
  personas and a handoff bus that carries context down the chain.
- Codex pipeline nodes reach the Bridge automatically via an injected `-c` override.
