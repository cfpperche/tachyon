# Changelog

All notable changes to Tachyon are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Older history lives in the git log and the
Marketplace release notes.

## 0.36.0 — Plugin skills

### Added
- **Plugins can now ship skills, not just hooks.** A plugin includes a `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` payload (written
  once), and Tachyon installs it into every present runtime that loads skills — **Claude** (`.claude/skills/`)
  and **Codex** (`.agents/skills/`), the same `SKILL.md` format for both. Skills install, update, and remove
  through the same Plugins View as hooks.
- **Your own skills are never silently overwritten.** When a plugin's skill would land where you already have a
  skill of that name, the consent drawer surfaces the collision with a **Keep mine / Replace** choice — Keep is
  the default, and **Replace requires a second explicit confirmation** (it permanently overwrites; there's no
  undo). Remove deletes exactly the skill-dirs Tachyon wrote, never your own.

### Internal
- Plugin engine extended to a second capability with a fail-closed security posture: the skill loader rejects
  symlink-escapes / oversized payloads / YAML-bomb frontmatter; install/remove are consent-fingerprint-bound
  (TOCTOU); and every lockfile skill-dir path is validated against the runtime's skills dir before it is ever
  trusted or deleted, so a corrupted lockfile can't turn a remove into an arbitrary delete.

## 0.35.0 — Plugins

### Added
- **The Plugins View — manage plugins from a new editor panel.** Open it from the **Plugins** button in the
  sidebar title bar (next to Inspect tmux). Per workspace, you can browse what's installed, install a plugin
  by its git source (`github:owner/repo@ref`), update, reinstall, and remove. Each plugin's native config
  block is merged into every runtime present in the workspace (claude + codex in v1; gemini is deferred).
- **A blocking security consent drawer before anything is written.** Installing, updating, or removing first
  shows the source provenance (resolved commit + integrity hash), the **full list of shell commands** the
  plugin will run on agent events, every file Tachyon will write, and a consent fingerprint. The apply is
  **bound to exactly what you consented to** — it refuses if the workspace or source moved since the preview,
  so a remote plugin's hooks are never wired silently or swapped out from under you.

### Internal
- Plugin engine completed end to end: a git source resolver + fetcher with a content-addressed cache,
  provenance + integrity pinned in the lockfile for byte-reproducible re-hydration, and a pure view-model
  layer (list + consent) so the UI's logic is unit-tested rather than buried in the VS Code layer.

## 0.34.3 — clearer Activity reminders

### Fixed
- **Tachyon's injected reminders no longer masquerade as human messages.** A `[tachyon] …` nudge (the
  handoff/continuity reminders Tachyon types into a pane) was rendering as a human chat bubble in the
  Activity feed, indistinguishable from what you typed. It now renders as a subtle, centered system chip
  (the agent still receives the reminder unchanged — this is purely how the feed reads).

### Internal
- Plugin system (engine, not yet surfaced in the UI): added a 3-way plugin updater that updates an
  installed plugin without clobbering your edits — it refuses (without force) when you've edited or would
  duplicate a plugin's hooks, and force-gates a downgrade.

## 0.34.2 — one cleanup path for agent teardown

### Fixed
- **Deleting a configured agent no longer orphans its activity log.** The 0.34.0/0.34.1 fixes cleaned the
  durable `.tachyon/activity/<agent>.jsonl` for ad-hoc kill, dismissal, and pipeline-node teardown, but the
  "Delete" action on a declared agent removed its config entry + session row while leaving the log behind —
  the same orphan class, just on the declared-delete path. Deleting an agent now drops its log with its row.

### Changed
- **Internal:** the "remove an ephemeral agent's session row + activity log" pair, previously open-coded at
  every teardown site (and the source of the drift that left orphans), is centralized into one shared,
  idempotent cleanup helper, so a future teardown path can't silently re-introduce an orphan. No behavior
  change for the existing kill/dismiss/pipeline paths.

## 0.34.1 — activity log also cleaned on kill

### Fixed
- **Killing an ad-hoc agent no longer leaves an orphaned activity log.** 0.34.0's cleanup (an agent's durable
  `.tachyon/activity/<agent>.jsonl` dies with its ledger row) covered dismissal and pipeline-node teardown but
  missed `kill` — which removes the row and, unlike a clean-exit dead pane, leaves no pane to view the log from,
  so the log was left unreachable on disk. Killing a non-persistent ad-hoc agent now deletes its log with the
  row. Found in live dogfood of 0.34.0.

## 0.34.0 — Delegation contract on agent-spawned AI sub-agents

### Added
- **When an agent delegates to a fresh AI sub-agent through the Bridge, it must now hand it a structured brief.**
  `spawn_agent` for an ad-hoc AI child requires a contract — **task + context + constraints + (deliverable OR
  done_when)** — or the call is rejected with a message naming what's missing, so the agent fixes it and retries.
  The accepted contract is composed into the child's opening instructions (it IS the child's brief, not just a
  checkpoint) and persisted with the agent. A genuinely trivial spawn can opt out with `skip_contract_reason`
  (≥10 chars), which is recorded and surfaced to you rather than silently allowed. Terminal (non-AI) children and
  agents declared in `tachyon.yml` are not gated. Enforced at the Bridge, so it works the same for any runtime
  (claude / codex / gemini / opencode); restarting, resuming, or forking an existing agent is never re-gated.

### Fixed / changed
- **A finished one-shot or pipeline `cmd:` node no longer leaves an orphaned, unreachable activity log.** The
  durable `.tachyon/activity/<agent>.jsonl` now shares the agent's lifecycle — it's removed when the agent is
  dismissed (a clean-exit ad-hoc) or its inline pipeline node is torn down, instead of accumulating on disk with
  no row to view it from. A declared agent keeps its log; the postmortem "Activity" view of a dead pane is
  unaffected (the log is dropped only at dismissal).
- **Launcher-wrapped AI commands (`npx claude`, `env -u VAR claude`, …) are now classified and prompted
  consistently** — a single resolver sees through `npx`/`bunx`/`env` for both kind-detection and prompt
  delivery, so a wrapped AI agent both gets gated and actually receives its brief.

## 0.33.0 — Project Handoff: agent-driven distill

### Added
- **An agent can now DISTILL the pending notes into the handoff — you just curate.** Reading the handoff
  (`get_project_handoff`) now returns the pending notes themselves (not just a count) plus a watermark, so an
  agent can fold them into a rewritten handoff, show you the draft, and on your OK write it
  (`set_project_handoff`). You stay the curator (approve / ask for changes); the agent does the typing.

### Fixed / changed
- **A note appended while a distill is in flight is never silently lost.** Pending is now tracked by an explicit
  distill watermark (which notes have actually been folded in), not by wall-clock — so a note that lands between
  an agent reading the handoff and writing the distilled version simply stays pending for the next pass. A plain
  rewrite (without declaring a distill) no longer clears pending — clearing is now an explicit, deliberate step.

## 0.32.1 — Project Handoff: quieter, smarter append-nudge

### Fixed
- **The "append a handoff note" reminder no longer nags an agent that has nothing new to log.** It now fires only
  when an agent has done real new work since it was last reminded or last appended (a per-agent activity-lag gate),
  on top of the existing per-workspace interval (`settings.handoff.nudgeEvery`). An agent that just logged — or
  that judged its recent work not worth a project note — won't be re-reminded for the same work.

## 0.32.0 — Project Handoff (shared state of the work)

### Added
- **A Project Handoff: one shared, curated "state of the work" per workspace — distinct from per-agent
  continuity.** Where per-agent continuity recovers an individual agent's thread, the handoff is the project-level
  picture (current state / active work / next actions / decisions & gotchas) that any human or freshly-resumed
  agent can read. Two lanes keep it correct in a multi-agent workspace without write conflicts:
  - **Canonical** `.tachyon/HANDOFF.md` — human/owner-curated, git-tracked, edited as a whole (concurrency-safe
    via compare-and-swap so a stale rewrite can't clobber a newer one).
  - **Pending notes** `.tachyon/handoff-notes.jsonl` — any agent appends a structured note (completed / blocked /
    decision / gotcha / next); the owner distills them into the canonical. Agents never rewrite the shared file.
  - **New Bridge tools:** `get_project_handoff`, `append_project_handoff_note`, `set_project_handoff`.
  - **A read-only editor panel** opens from a per-folder button in the sidebar (with a staleness badge: Fresh /
    Needs distill · N / Possibly stale / Old), rendering the handoff + the pending notes.
  - **A light, opt-out nudge** reminds an idle agent to append a note when project state changed — throttled
    per-workspace via `settings.handoff.nudgeEvery` (default `30m`, set `off` to disable). The handoff path is
    overridable via `settings.handoff.path`.

## 0.31.2 — Resume reopens the current session after `/clear` (shared cwd)

### Fixed
- **Stop→resume now reopens the session you were actually in, even after a `/clear` on a shared folder.** 0.31.1
  made the Activity feed *follow* a `/clear`; this completes the loop for *resuming*. Before, resuming a Claude
  agent that shared a folder with others could reopen the **pre-`/clear`** conversation, because the stored
  session id was never advanced past the rotation. Tachyon now uses the same per-agent ownership ledger (0.31.1)
  to pick the resume target — at stop, at resume, and for the sidebar's resumable badge — so it reopens the
  current session and never another agent's. Agents that manage their own session (`claude --resume …`) and
  non-Claude runtimes are unchanged; agents started before 0.31.1 keep the prior behavior until their next start.

## 0.31.1 — Activity keeps logging after `/clear` (shared cwd)

### Fixed
- **The Activity feed no longer freezes after `/clear` (or an in-TUI `/resume`) when several Claude agents share
  one folder.** Previously, once an agent's session id was captured, a `/clear` rotated Claude to a brand-new
  session that — on a shared working directory — Tachyon couldn't attribute from disk (Claude discards the
  Tachyon-set title and writes no parent link), so the durable Activity log stayed pinned to the old, frozen
  transcript and silently stopped recording. Tachyon now spawns each Claude agent with a per-spawn `--settings`
  `SessionStart` hook that records which session belongs to which agent in a small ledger
  (`.tachyon/activity/session-owners.jsonl`); the Activity view follows that **positive** signal, so it tracks a
  rotation exactly — and can never attribute another agent's session to the wrong log. No `~/.claude` or repo
  `.claude/` settings are touched (the `--settings` layer is additive, so your own hooks still run). Agents that
  manage their own session (`claude --resume …`) or already pass `--settings` are left untouched.

## 0.31.0 — Sortable sidebar (no more status churn)

### Changed
- **The Agents and Terminals lists are now a single flat list you sort yourself** — instead of bucketing into
  Running / Idle / Stopped groups that reflowed every time an agent changed state. The default is **Name (A–Z)**,
  a stable order where a status change just **recolors the dot in place** (no more rows jumping around). A sort
  control in the section header offers **Name (A–Z) · Name (Z–A) · Status (live)**; your choice is remembered.
  Status stays at-a-glance via the colored dot (hover for the label) and compact **per-status count chips** in the
  header. Other sections (Pipelines, Runbooks, Commands, Schedules, Pins) are unchanged.
  - **Note:** existing users will see Agents/Terminals switch from status-groups to a flat A–Z list by default —
    pick **Status (live)** from the new sort control to get the old status-first ordering back.

## 0.30.2 — Continuity nudges name the agent

### Fixed
- **The continuity nudge now spells out the agent's exact name in the `set_continuity` call.** An agent doesn't
  know its own Tachyon name, so when nudged it could guess wrong (e.g. write its brief under `main`) — the brief
  landed in the wrong file and its badge/recovery never saw it. Tachyon types the nudge and knows the name, so it
  now writes `set_continuity(agent: "<name>", …)` literally; the tool also warns against guessing.

## 0.30.1 — Continuity polish

### Fixed
- The continuity re-injection no longer points at `cat .tachyon/roles/<agent>.md` when that role doc doesn't
  exist (it only appears for agents you've actually re-anchored) — no more `cat` of a missing file.

## 0.30.0 — Per-agent continuity + richer diffs

### Added
- **Per-agent continuity — each agent keeps its working memory across session boundaries.** An agent now
  maintains a short continuity brief (`.tachyon/continuity/<agent>.md`: current goal, working state, decisions,
  next steps, open threads). When the agent crosses a **discontinuity** — a context compaction, a `/clear`, a
  restart, or a new session — Tachyon automatically types a "rebuild your context" pointer into the pane so the
  agent picks up where it left off, instead of starting blank. It is **hands-off for you**: the agent writes the
  brief (nudged by Tachyon when it's missing or falling behind), and Tachyon re-injects it on its own. Crucially,
  a **clean same-session resume is NOT re-injected** (no double-context). A sidebar badge shows
  fresh / **◐ stale** / **○ missing**, and `Tachyon: Re-inject Continuity` forces it on demand. claude-only in v1;
  no LLM cost (the agent authors the brief). `.tachyon/continuity/` is gitignored.
- **Richer Edit/Write diffs in the Activity view** — tool diffs now render TUI-style: a per-line gutter with old/
  new line numbers, the +/− sign, syntax-highlighted code (by file type), and green/red row backgrounds, instead
  of flat monospace text.

## 0.29.2 — Toggle isolation on an existing agent

### Fixed
- **Turning on `isolate: transcript` (or `harness:`) for an agent that already has history now takes effect on
  Restart.** Previously the agent's recorded config home was pinned to where its earlier sessions lived, so a
  restart kept looking there and the newly-isolated session showed an empty Activity view. A restart mints a
  fresh session, so it now re-homes to the current config home (old history stays where it was — a transcript
  can't be moved; resuming an existing session still uses its original home). A `claude --continue`/`--resume`
  agent, which owns its own session, still needs a delete + recreate to re-home.

## 0.29.1 — Task-list rendering + Studio isolate toggle

### Fixed
- **Markdown task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) rendered as stray empty boxes in the Activity feed.** The upstream
  task-list plugin emits malformed, space-less checkbox markup; Tachyon now renders each item as a proper
  styled checkbox glyph (read-only, matching the rest of the cockpit).

### Added
- **`Isolate transcript` checkbox in the Agent Studio.** The spec-240 per-agent transcript isolation is now a
  one-click toggle when creating/editing a claude agent (still off by default; claude-only; hidden when the
  heavier `Isolated harness` is on, which already isolates the transcript).

### Changed
- **`Open transcript` moved from the Activity header to a command.** The raw runtime `.jsonl` is a power-user /
  debug escape hatch, so it's now the `Tachyon: Open Raw Transcript` palette command (targets the active
  Activity panel) instead of a header button — the rendered, durable Activity log is the primary surface.

## 0.29.0 — Backward paging + per-agent transcript isolation

### Added
- **Load earlier activity (in-panel backward paging).** The Activity view can now reach OLDER history without
  leaving the panel — a "Load earlier activity" button grows the rendered window backward over the durable log,
  keeping your scroll position anchored on the item you were reading (no jump). Bounded (it defers to "open
  transcript" past a hard cap, so the payload stays sane).
- **`isolate: transcript` — per-agent transcript namespace (spec 240).** Declare it on a claude agent to give
  it its OWN claude config home (a separate transcript namespace) WITHOUT the heavier `harness:` MCP isolation:

  ```yaml
  agents:
    reviewer:
      cmd: claude
      isolate: transcript
  ```

  Now multiple agents that share ONE folder each get an attributable session, an in-TUI `/resume`/`/clear` that
  the Activity view follows, and their own durable activity log — while still loading the workspace project
  config (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, which are cwd-relative) and inheriting your existing claude
  login (no re-auth). The fix for "several agents in the same folder, one shows no activity."

### Fixed
- Session attribution is now drift-safe: the config home a session was written under is persisted, so a later
  `isolate`/`harness` toggle or rename can't make Tachyon look in the wrong place; startup GC no longer reaps a
  still-referenced transcript home.

## 0.28.1 — Activity in shared folders

### Fixed
- **The Activity view was empty for agents that share a workspace folder.** When ≥2 agents run in the same
  directory (the common case), the durable-log writer was over-suppressed and captured nothing, so the cockpit
  showed "Waiting for activity…" for a working agent. It now attributes each agent's session safely by its
  captured uuid or unique title even in a shared folder (only the genuinely ambiguous, id-less case is gapped,
  with an honest notice) — so each agent's history shows correctly. No misattribution: the only ambiguous
  fallback (a bare "newest in this folder" scan) is skipped on a shared cwd.

## 0.28.0 — Durable activity history

### Added
- **The Activity view now keeps each agent's full, normalized history — durably.** A per-agent activity log
  (`.tachyon/activity/<agent>.jsonl`) is written continuously by an always-on writer, so the cockpit shows a
  complete, stitched timeline across `/clear`, `/resume`, context compaction, fresh starts and restarts —
  history that would otherwise be lost when the runtime rotates session files. The log is a normalized
  projection (not a raw clone): provenance pointers back to the source records, content-addressed copies of
  the images it renders, and it survives runtime-side pruning.
- **Session & compaction boundaries are rendered as separators.** Compaction shows "context compacted" with
  the token delta and an expandable summary; session changes show "new session" / "resumed session" /
  "restarted session" / "forked session" — labeled from Tachyon's own Start/Restart/Resume/Fork actions when
  it performs them, inferred from the transcript otherwise.
- **Rich rendering in the Activity feed** (since 0.27): markdown via markdown-it (tables, task lists, quotes),
  syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy, Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX (KaTeX), thinking blocks, tool diffs,
  inline images with click-to-zoom, a live "working…" indicator, in-feed search, and a visible "recent N of
  M" cap notice instead of silently dropping older activity.

### Changed
- The Activity panel is now a read-only subscriber to the durable log (it no longer tails the runtime
  transcript directly). Opening a long session is bounded (fast) instead of re-reading the whole file.
- Post-compaction artifacts (the continuation summary, `/`-command wrappers, local-command output) are no
  longer mis-rendered as human chat messages.

### Notes
- Per-agent history is captured from now forward; on a folder shared by ≥2 agents, session stitching is
  suppressed (an honest "history stitching limited" notice) rather than risk mis-attribution.

## 0.27.0 — New sidebar

### Changed
- **The Tachyon sidebar is now a purpose-built webview panel, replacing the native tree.** Icon tabs per
  section (Agents, Terminals, Pipelines, Schedules, Commands, Runbooks, Pins), a global `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K`
  search across the whole fleet, capability-gated per-row actions with a consistent `…` overflow menu
  (Edit in Studio / Edit YAML / Delete), multi-root folders shown together and grouped, a view toolbar
  (server inspector / refresh / settings), live state for every section, and full keyboard accessibility.
- The legacy tree is removed (the `tachyon.sidebar.legacyTree` opt-in is gone). All existing commands and
  Studios are unchanged — the panel drives the same actions.

### Added
- Per-section "new …" create buttons; Commands/Runbooks show real run state (running/passed/failed) with
  open-output and step expansion; pipelines gate Run/Cancel/Dismiss/Review by run state and auto-expand on
  start; schedules reflect paused state; an honest empty state with an "Initialize Tachyon" action.

## 0.26.0 — Zero-config Bridge

### Added
- **Every Tachyon-spawned agent reaches the MCP Bridge automatically.** Tachyon injects the
  Bridge at spawn — Claude via an additive `--mcp-config`, Codex via an additive
  `-c mcp_servers.tachyon_bridge=…`, and an isolated-harness Claude has it folded into its
  scoped (`--strict-mcp-config`) file. Injection re-runs on **spawn, restart, resume, and fork**
  (a momentarily-down Bridge self-heals on the next start), and the token never lands on the
  command line. **No `.mcp.json` / `config.toml` registration is needed** for agents Tachyon
  spawns. `Tachyon: Connect Agent Runtime` remains, now scoped to **external/manual** sessions
  you start yourself.

### Fixed
- An isolated-harness agent with `inherit: none` no longer silently loses the Bridge — it is
  always folded into the materialized strict MCP file, so the agent can still call
  `complete_node` / `write_input`.

### Changed
- Pipeline preflight now treats a Tachyon-spawned Claude node as Bridge-capable (injection
  guarantees it — no project `.mcp.json` evidence required); a node whose command disables MCP
  (`--safe-mode`) is correctly reported as unable to signal completion.

### Removed
- The discontinued **layouts** feature was retired (legacy config keys remain tolerated).

### Internal
- The engine is now decoupled from VS Code behind a host port, enforced by a CI boundary guard.
- The `Workspace` is headless-testable (`createForTest` + an in-memory host).

## 0.25.0 — Agent Pipelines, input-driven
- Input-driven pipelines: one definition becomes a reusable workflow run per issue, with agent
  personas and a handoff bus that carries context down the chain.
- Codex pipeline nodes reach the Bridge automatically via an injected `-c` override.
